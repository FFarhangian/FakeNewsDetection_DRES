## Abstract
The rapid spread of information via social media has made text-based fake news detection critically important due to its societal impact. This paper presents a novel detection method called **Dynamic Representation and Ensemble Selection (DRES)** for identifying fake news based solely on text. DRES leverages **instance hardness measures** to estimate classification difficulty for each news article across multiple textual feature representations. By dynamically selecting both (i) the **textual representation** and (ii) the most competent **ensemble of classifiers** per instance, DRES significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRES achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of **representation selection + dynamic ensemble selection** in boosting performance.

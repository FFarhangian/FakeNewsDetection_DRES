N Feature representations
M classifiers for all representations
MXN models trained for the problem.


Training process (Meta-training, or training of the combination model)

For each n_i in N{
    
    t_i = get the training data from n_i (maybe use data augmentation)
    train a KNORA-Eliminate with t_i and pool m_i
    train a stacking model

}

Output of the training 

N Stacking classifiers
N KNoraEliminate (or other DS method)



Inference:

For each Xq in Test:
    estimate the difficulty (hardness) over the N representations
    R = Select all representations with lower hardness (all with the same being the lowest)
    //R is the set of select representations (i.e, the ones the classification should work)

    for each r_i in R:
        apply the DS technique ds_i trained over r_i
        select the C in m_i according to the DS technique ds_i
        majority voting with all models in C
